# deep_learning_challenge Analysis 

The purpose of this analysis is to develop a deep learning model to classify Alphabet Soup's charitable organizations based on historical data. The goal is to create a model that can accurately predict whether a new organization is likely to be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

Results:
Data Preprocessing:
Target Variable: The target variable for the model is 'IS_SUCCESSFUL', which indicates whether a charitable organization was successful (1) or not (0).

Features: The features for the model are the columns in the application_df DataFrame after dropping the 'EIN' and 'NAME' columns. These features are used to predict the target variable 'IS_SUCCESSFUL'.

Variables Removed: The 'EIN' and 'NAME' columns have been removed from the input data as they are neither targets nor features.

Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model:
The deep learning model was constructed with three hidden layers, each followed by a dropout layer to prevent overfitting. The model's architecture consists of 200 neurons with the LeakyReLU activation function in the first hidden layer, 200 neurons with the tanh activation function in the second hidden layer, and 100 neurons with the sigmoid activation function in the third hidden layer. The output layer has a single neuron with the sigmoid activation function.

During the training process, the model demonstrated improvements in performance, and the dropout layers helped mitigate overfitting. The achieved test accuracy was Test Accuracy: 0.731195330619812. However, there is still potential to further improve the model's performance.

Recommendations:
To enhance the model's performance, consider exploring the following

Hyperparameter Tuning: Perform a more extensive hyperparameter search to find optimal values for the number of neurons, dropout rates, and learning rate. 

Learning Rate Scheduling: Implement learning rate scheduling to adjust the learning rate during training. This approach can help the model converge faster and achieve better performance.

More Data: If possible, consider acquiring more data to increase the training set size. More data can enhance the model's ability to generalize to unseen samples.

Feature Selection: Investigate feature selection techniques to identify the most important features for the target variable. Eliminating less relevant features may simplify the model and improve its predictive power.

By exploring these strategies and fine-tuning the model, it is possible to build a more accurate and reliable deep learning model for classifying Alphabet Soup's charitable organizations. Continuously monitoring and optimizing the model will enable better decision-making and resource allocation for Alphabet Soup.

Summary:
The deep learning model demonstrates promising results in classifying charitable organizations. The achieved test accuracy of 0.731195330619812 indicates the model's potential for predicting the success of new organizations. However, there is still room for improvement.
